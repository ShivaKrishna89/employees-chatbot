- Remove generic words like department,dept from extracted department values.

Allowed intents:
CREATE, CHECK, UPDATE, DELETE

Intent rules:
- If the user is asking whether an employee exists or asking for details, intent is CHECK
- If the user is asking to create or onboard an employee, intent is CREATE
- If the user is asking to update employee details, intent is UPDATE
- If the user is asking to delete an employee, intent is DELETE
- If resume content is present, intent is CREATE
